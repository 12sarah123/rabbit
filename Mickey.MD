"MickeyVPN" permanently free, one-click connection, free access to the Internet.

1. in order to ensure the stability and speed of the Mickey, the author does not want the Mickey to be abused, especially the P2P protocol downloaded by BT& magnetic force / thunder.

2. If all lines are blocked, it means that the server is blocked extensively. Please give the rabbit more patience to restore the service (in 48 hours).

3. 1 to 3 lines will always be fixed as forbidden video lines to provide guarantees for web/social services (friends who need video services please choose other lines)

4. Mickey is just a product of personal interest, not intended for commercial use.

5. Don't share the Mickey with others at will, because the more users the slower, the more server fees the author will be unable to bear! If you want to support, click on the advertisement when connecting.

6. Later, more national routes will be opened to provide proxy services for more national users.

Common problems:

1. In order to relieve the line pressure, the Mickey will be disconnected for more than 2 hours each time. After disconnection, the Mickey will need to reconnect manually.

2. Because of the complex network in different areas, different operators in different areas have different effects on connecting the same line. If a line is not available or the network speed is slow, please turn off VPN and wait a little later or choose another line to try again. If the line is unavailable, the server where the line is located may be down. Wait for the author to repair and restart the line.

3. Restrict some lines to watch videos, which is also for the sake of smoothly providing friends who use Goole search, online shopping, social networking and other scenarios.

4. About flip-flop: Mickey will call the VPN service that comes with the system when it runs. If your mobile phone system is customized by a third party or VPN service is streamlined/deleted, Mickey can do nothing about it. If your mobile phone system is the manufacturer's original system, and there is no Root, please leave a message to the author's Google Store. The author will try to fix other errors such as flicker.

Frequent dropouts (important)

1. Please add this software to the whitelist of background operation. (How to operate please own Google or Baidu, domestic mobile phone manufacturers have different systems)

2. There are power saving optimization (battery optimization) options in settings-batteries and performance. For each application, choosing not to optimize can ensure resident backstage.

3. Disconnect when not needed to save resources.

4. This software has been banned from downloading P2P protocols such as BT & Magnetism/Thunderbolt
